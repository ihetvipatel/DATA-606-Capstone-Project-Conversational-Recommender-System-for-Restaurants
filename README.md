Project Proposal: Conversational Recommender System for Restaurants
Team Members: Hafsa Chaudhry, Omar Agha Khan, Hetvi Patel, and Sarah Denlinger

Dataset: The dataset can be obtained from Yelp's Open Dataset website (https://www.yelp.com/dataset). 

This dataset includes over 5 million reviews for businesses in 11 metropolitan areas across 4 countries.

Basic Info: The dataset includes information such as the reviewer's name, the date of the review, the rating given by the reviewer, and the text of the review. There are also details about the business such as its name, location, category, and attributes.

A conversational recommender system is a type of recommendation system that is integrated into a chatbot and uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to make recommendations in a conversational manner. To build a conversational recommender system for restaurants, we would need to perform several steps, including:

Analyses:
Pre-processing the data: Clean and prepare the restaurant review data for analysis.
Sentiment Analysis: Determine the overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of each review.
Text Classification: Classify the reviews into categories based on their content, such as food quality, service quality, atmosphere, etc.
Keyword Extraction: Extract the most frequently mentioned keywords in the reviews to determine the topics being discussed.
Recommendation Engine: Use the results of the sentiment analysis, text classification, and keyword extraction to build a recommendation engine that can suggest restaurants to users based on their preferences and opinions.

Performance Evaluation Metric:
For sentiment analysis, the performance evaluation metric could be the accuracy of the sentiment analysis results.
For text classification, the performance evaluation metric could be the F1-score, which is a measure of the accuracy of the classifier.
For the recommendation engine, the performance evaluation metric could be the Mean Average Precision (MAP), which measures the average precision of the recommendations made by the engine.

Integration into Chatbot: Create a chatbot that can engage in natural language conversations with users and make recommendations based on the results of the recommendation engine. The chatbot can ask questions to gather information about the user's preferences and use that information to make recommendations.  For example, the chatbot might ask questions like "Are you in the mood for Italian food?" or "Do you prefer fine dining or casual dining?" Based on the user's answers, the chatbot can use the recommendation engine to suggest restaurants that match the user's preferences. The chatbot can then provide the user with additional information about the recommended restaurants, such as their locations, menus, and hours of operation
